      a: "When you run out of email quota, the addon will temporary stop running. You will have to wait for quota renewal to send email again. If you are Free user, you can purchase Individual Plan and enjoy much higher quotas (at least 5000 emails/month) and unlimited emails sent per day.",

      a: "Emails & Requests are different. For examples, if you set up a workflow with 2 recipients, a form respondent submit a request then 2 emails counted to be sent to 2 recipients. In average, a request from our users consists of 4 emails. That is why free plan (500 emails) is calculated to be approximately 125 requests per month. The smaller number of recipient you set up in the workflow, the more request you have with a fixed email quota and vice versa.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why the addon requires access to my Google Drive?",
      a: "Permission to Google Drive is only necessary for the addon to perform actions related to your connected Google Form and spreadsheet on your behalf. In no circumstance that we will use those files for any other purposes or sharing to third parties.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does approval workflow feature work?",
      a: "When a Form Respondent sends a request, the addon will automatically send approval notification email to your specified recipient(s). Recipient can make One-click approve/reject decision on email, or, approve/reject & comment on BoloForms Approvals website. Finally, an email will be sent to all recipients notifying the final result.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does recipient need Google Account?",
      a: "No. Recipients do not need Google account. They also do not need to have access to your Google Form or spreadsheet. When a request is sent, recipient will receive an email which includes: One-click Approve & One-click Reject button: to approve/reject immediately. Approve/Reject & Comment button: to open BoloForms Website where you can approve/reject & give comment on the request.",
    },
    {
      q: "How many recipients can I add?",
      a: "There is no limit to the number of recipients. However, be aware that the higher number of recipients is, the quicker your emails quota may run out.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can Form Respondent or Recipients edit a form submission?",
